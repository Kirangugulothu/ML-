# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This repository contains a tutorial and implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The notebook walks through the basic principles behind CNNs, their architectural components (convolution, pooling, flattening, fully connected layers), and their application to visual data.

##  Tutorial Overview

In this notebook, you will learn:
- What Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are and how they work
- How to build a CNN using Keras (TensorFlow backend)
- How CNNs process image data using filters and feature maps
- Techniques to improve performance (dropout, activation functions)
- Visualizing training accuracy and validation loss
- How to apply CNNs for classification on image datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10)
